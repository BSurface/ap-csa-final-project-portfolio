## Generative Art

### Description
> After experimenting with the Perlin Noise Graph and seeing the potential of generative art through JavaScript, I immediately came up with the idea of a fish constantly trying to get a line, which had an illusion that it was being pulled away. Additionally, I wanted some user interaction experience, so I decided that the user would be able to control the line to some degree, but there would still be that aspect of randomness synonymous with the Perlin noise. Doing this generative art was challenging yet very rewarding, as I had a specific goal in mind, and I had to continue tweaking small details to make my vision come to life.

### Technologies or Tools Used
> I used VSCode paired with a means to display the artwork in a separate Google window. I also used the initial Perlin Noise Graph video as inspiration for my creation.
