## Flashback and Ethical Hacking Podcasts 

### Description
> Both of these podcasts were extremely fun to make, from the initial research process to recording and editing the podcast itself. Firstly, for the ethical hacking podcast, I wanted to delve into the real-world applications of a deep understanding of how software works, and how data is transferred. The history aspect of ethical hacking was extremely interesting as well, and it is amazing to think that a small whistle can lead to a huge industry involving white-hat hacking and personal and government data. Next, for the Ouya project, I felt that it ventured in a different direction furthering my understanding of early mobile software, such as Android's Jelly Bean.
### Technologies or Tools Used
> I created a list of sources referenced for each podcast, and for my ethical hacking podcast, I created a simple website to showcase the audio and transcript using HTML and CSS through Github. For my flashback podcast, I used Soundtrap to edit and lay music over my script.
