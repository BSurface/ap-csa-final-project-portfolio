## Project 1: Discord Bot - Surface Bot 
### Description
  > Originally starting as a sports-statistic bot, Surface Bot switched functions to focus on utilizing AI through Chat-GPT to answer specific questions in Discord. Since many of the sports-oriented APIs online were either significantly outdated or not free to use, I pivoted away from those APIs to integrate Chat-GPT 3.5's API and started attempting to utilize DALL E image generation.
### Technologies and Tools Used
  > I used Chat-GPT's built-in API, as well as Python in VSCode to construct my bot. Additionally, I used Discord's bot initialization to get Surface Bot running within the Thunderdome server.
