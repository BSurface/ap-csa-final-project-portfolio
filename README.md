## ap-csa-final-project-portfolio

  I started my computer science journey during my junior year through Honors Coding and Computer Science. Initially, my goals were straightforward: I wanted to build my coding skills to create fun projects such as games. However, as I started to delve deeper into the subject and really understand some of the more computer-science-oriented topics, my goals expanded. Watching videos on YouTube such as Sebastien Lague's game-dev portfolio or the numerous AI learning algorithms for teaching bots, I became inspired to diversify my coding knowledge to different languages and use cases, such as learning C++ for my Steam game or utilizing panda libraries for data parsing. Additionally, I made it a goal to explore how computer science can be used in other industries outside of just software, specifically in the business sphere as I want to focus on that in the future, but also other concentrations as AI becomes more prevalent.
