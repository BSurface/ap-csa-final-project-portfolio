## Protect the President Unity Game

### Description
> Using the Unity engine helped reinforce specific Java logic through fun and creative means. since Java is similar to C++. While the project was unfortunately lost, it was a massive step up in complication from learning the ins and outs of Unity, to learning C++, to then coordinating all the different scripts, objects, UI, etc. Additionally, leaving room to create new enemies was especially important and something that I needed to work around in my code and specific variables. My final goal was to create a level system game that could have speedrunning scores, with harder and harder levels involving new enemies that shoot at different speeds and frequencies with different bullets.

### Technology or Tools Used
> I used a couple of YouTube videos to get the projectile and player movement system down, as well as the Unity engine to create my game.
